# Crypto Portfolio Tracker, a great overview of al your crypto HODL positions

## Description
Those who are actively working on a crypto HODL or Swing portfolio or get the feeling at some point that they don't have a good view anymore where they have stored certain crypto coins. This is when they start using an excel-sheet to keep track of it. Or at least try to keep track of it.
I have been at that same spot. And finally decided to develop my own desktop app for this. I know that there are websites offering you the same, but still your portfolio overview is 'somewhere out there' and might be visible for others. And even with these tracker services you need to add some coins and transactions manually because they are not supported.
This app is retrieving its information via the GoinGecko public API.

## Main Features
* COIN LIBRARY for building up a list of coins you are interested in. Just see the coins you want and get rid of the overhead.
* ACCOUNTS collection to build up a list of locations where you have stored your crypto assets.
* ASSETS overview of your positions your are holding in your total portfolio
* Build up your assets by adding transactions using a detailed Transaction Dialog with validating entry boxes.
* Combined transactions possible, like a buy/sell/convert including a transfer from one account to another. Fee settings are included as wel.
* Select a coin in the Assets overview and you get a view of all your accounts holding this coin, including detailed transactions for this coin at the selected account.
* Transactions can be edited or deleted.
* The Accounts overview includes the total market value of that account. Selecting an account will give you a detailed view all the coins in that account.

## First Use
* First, start with building up the Coin Library
* Second, assign one or more accounts
* Third, start building up your assets with adding transactions.



Enjoy HODL-ing
